# ðŸš€ STEP-BY-STEP: Deploy HeadLight to ODOT Converter to Streamlit

## What You're Doing
You're going to put your app on the internet so customers can use it without downloading anything!

## Step 1: Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" 
3. Create a free account
4. Verify your email

## Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. **Sign in to GitHub**
2. **Click the green "New" button** (or the "+" in top right corner)
3. **Fill out the form:**
   - Repository name: `headlight-odot-converter`
   - Description: `HeadLight to ODOT PDF Converter`
   - Make sure it's **Public** (this is important!)
   - **Don't check** any of the boxes at the bottom
4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 3: Upload Your Files
1. **Download the ZIP file** I created: `HeadLight_ODOT_Converter_GitHub_Ready.zip`
2. **Extract the ZIP file** to a folder on your computer
3. **In your new GitHub repository:**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag ALL the files from the extracted folder into the upload area
   - Type a commit message: `Initial commit - HeadLight to ODOT converter`
   - Click "Commit changes"

## Step 4: Deploy to Streamlit
1. **Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)**
2. **Sign in with your GitHub account**
3. **Click "New app"**
4. **Fill out the form:**
   - Repository: Select `yourusername/headlight-odot-converter`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file path: `streamlit_app.py`
5. **Click "Deploy!"**
6. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for it to build

## Step 5: Share with Customers
1. **Copy the URL** Streamlit gives you (looks like: `https://headlight-odot-converter-yourusername.streamlit.app`)
2. **Send this URL to your customers**
3. **They can use it immediately** - no downloads needed!

## What Your Customers Will See
- A clean web page with file upload buttons
- They upload their HeadLight JSON file
- Optionally upload photos
- Click "Convert to ODOT PDF"
- Download the finished PDF

## Troubleshooting
- **If GitHub asks for verification:** Check your email and click the verification link
- **If Streamlit deployment fails:** Make sure your repository is Public
- **If files don't upload:** Make sure you extracted the ZIP file first

## Success!
Once deployed, your app will be available 24/7 on the internet. Customers can use it anytime without you needing to run anything on your computer!
